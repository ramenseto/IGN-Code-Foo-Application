I've made a website before in the past when I was in middle school. My ISP provided me with a WYSIWYG editor and I mostly just put a collection of gifs up. So other than that, I have only basic web design knowledge. This was a good chance to learn about liquid layouts for me. I had to do my research on how to use it from the internet. Below are sources I used for attempting this.

I used the maxdesign site to learn about how to implement a simple layout. The webdesign.html.it site was used to find a premade javascript script file. The draac site was used to test out the html page because I don't have access to any website building software. I used Skydrive to put the CSS and Javascript files so that it can be accessed when linking on the draac html previewer.

The layout does support both 1024x768 and 1680x1050, both widescreen and nonwidescreen resolutions. The point of using a liquid layout is to accommodate the different display viewports of the audience. With a liquid layout, webpages will self adjust in the browser based on percentage of screen instead of fixed pixel widths which may cut off parts of a page.
