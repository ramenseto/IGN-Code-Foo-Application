I used the internet to find the out information that will help me solve the problem. A regular sized pingpong ball is 40mm, making the volume of the sphere 1.767 cubic inches. There are many different types of school buses, but I found one that someone bought off eBay to remodel and use for living space giving the dimensions of 35' x 6.5' x 7.5'. This gives 2948400 cubic inches as the volume of an empty school bus. I assume that that this bus has all windows/doors/emergency exits are closed so that balls can be filled to capacity. Also, I assume that the seats are not taken out. Since I haven't been on a school bus since elementary school, I guess that there are 10 rows of 2 benches on the bus. I estimate each bench has 2 flat pieces(the seat and the back), having dimensions of 48" x 36" x 3". This gives a volume of 103680 cubic inches to be subtracted from the volume of the bus when empty, giving 2844720 cubic inches of free space inside a school bus with seats still intact. I take the volume of free space and divide it by the volume of the pingpong balls to give 1609915 pingpong balls. Then I take into account that the balls are spherical and will not utilize all empty space and throw in the concept of "sphere packing"(multiply result by .75) to reduce the number to 12007436 pingpong balls.
